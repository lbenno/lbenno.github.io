My name is Lauren Benson.  I am Senior Operations Manager at Elinvar GmbH, a FinTech start-up in Berlin, Germany.  I am expanding on my skillset (business analysis, process improvement, project management) by learniing backend development.


My focus is data analysis and visualisation, proces automation, and projects I can apply in daily life: 

`python`    [ `Flask`, `Django`, `Pandas` ]

`sql`    

`html`      [ `markdown` ]
