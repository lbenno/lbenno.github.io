My name is Lauren Benson.  I'm Senior Operations Manager at Elinvar GmbH, a FinTech start-up in Berlin, Germany.  

I am expanding on my current skillset of operational mamagement, business analysis, process improvement, and project management by learning backend development.


My focus is on projects incorporating data analysis and visualisation, process automation, and other projects that I can apply in my personal and professional life.
