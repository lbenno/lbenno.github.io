## What I did 

+ Setup `GitHub` and `GitHubPages` accounts, and created my first `Repo` 
+ Deployed a basic `.html` file using `git` commands from a `VSCode` integrated `Terminal`. 
It was confusing and required a lot of troubleshooting, but when it all actually worked.... well excited is an understatement.  Honestly I was really proud and it felt like christening the beginning of a long and rewarding journey üòä

## My first code 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
    <h1>hello World</h1>
    <p>This is my first attempt at coding.
        I just learned to commit to a GitHub Page from VSCode.
        Have a great day :-).</p>
    <h2>#skateordie</h2>
</body>
</html>
```

## My observations
From my colleagues and friends, and content creators, I took away some observations regarding how to get started in development and data science: 

1. **DO PROJECTS**
+ tutorials are great, but self-driven projects are where the real learning happens
+ doing *something*, no matter how minor is super important to making  progress 

1. **SHOW YOUR WORK**
+ make it as visual/visible as possible (i.e. even if it's not deployed, publish screencaptures or write about and post on LinkedIn, in a Blog/Vlog etc.
+ that's why I'm starting this site about my coding journey.  It will also be great to look back on my progress and see how far I've come.

2. **NO-ONE ELSE HAS IT TOTALLY FIGURED OUT EITHER**
+ it's easy to be overwhelmed by learning ahead of me, but the main thing is keep going and remember that everyone, even experts, are on a journey
+ everyone uses Google and Stackoverflow to troubleshoot... it doesn't mean you're a failure... it means you're using all the resources at your disposal to solve problems independently üí™


## What's next? 
+ I need to learn `<html>` - how to get inputs and present outputs on the web (or other interface), based on the backend logic I'm developing. I want to build webites/apps that **do** something, not just **show** something
    + will look into learning `Django` - a web framework writen in `Python`


Also... I will forever call data ‚ÄúDah-Tah‚Äù and not "Day-tah" no matter what anyone says ü§£
